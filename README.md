### A student record management software is a tool that tracks, record, manage and maintain student information in an institute. This application is basically for the school 
### In simple words, a student record management system is a software solution that was developed especially for education institutes to help tackle little operational challenges. The system is CLI-base and will allow you to automate collection of student data in improving efficiency and accuracy

# LIMITATION 
### In the process of creating the software, we encountered some challenges that limited us from adding more features to the software: 
### -The text file keeps encoding into mojibake format, we tried converting the text fie to a UTF-8 but anytime we rerun the program it goes back to ANSI encoding 
### -This mini project research work is about creating a command-line software named: STUDENT RECORD MANAGEMENT SYSTEM that helps in computerizing the process of managing student record.

# The software after creation would be able to save student record on a text file 
-	### The student record management allows admins to be able to:
1.	### Add, delete, update, and view student details
2.	### Add, delete, update, and view student result
3.	### Student can view and update their details
4.	### There is a login system for the admin 
5.	### A unique identifier was created instead of using student matric number
